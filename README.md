# ü¶† COVID-19 Detection System Using MobileNetV2

An intelligent, fast, and lightweight Deep Learning-based solution for detecting COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images using **MobileNetV2**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for quick and reliable diagnostic tools. This project utilizes **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network, to classify chest X-ray images into three categories:
- **COVID-19 Positive**
- **Viral Pneumonia**
- **Normal (Healthy)**

The system provides high accuracy with minimal computational resources, making it suitable for real-time applications and deployment on mobile or edge devices.
